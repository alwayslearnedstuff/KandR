{"name":"K and R","tagline":"A journey through \"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan (the 'K') and Dennis Ritchie (the 'R'), published in 1978 and known universally as: K and R","body":"# K and R\r\n\r\n_The C Programming Language_ is a seminal book in programming history and computing in general. While not unusual in how the book outlines the syntax and grammar of C, it _is_ remarkable for how well it's written. It's like a conversation with history, as you encounter concepts and techniques still used today...which _originated_ here! For example, anybody who's done Hello, World in Java has encountered argv, and wondered, \"What the hell is that?!\" Well, you'll find the explanation and origin in this book. \r\n\r\nThing is...there are _dozens_ of examples like this and you feel as if you're reading the bible: the original source material. But it's not as if this was the first book of it's kind. There were other manuals written at the time on how to use certain languages. What set this apart-and still makes it relevant-is the combination of concise, beautiful writing sprinkled with excellent and challenging user-case examples throughout. It's also organized really logically as if, \"Duh! Is there any _other_ way to have written this?!\" That's really difficult to do. \r\n\r\n_The C Programming Language_ is not a long book, and almost 40 years later, the answers are littered all over the internet. But there's still much to be learned from digging in and doing it yourself, which is what I've done here. And as cleanly written as it is, there's still room for improvement (great example of that: [c-0]). Dennis Ritchie died in 2011, but Brian Kernighan is still alive and has graciously provided insights on certain of the more opaque passages, which is much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this site is not only personal, but to also open a sort of dialog and provide clarification and insight where possible from a learner's perspective.
