//Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line. 


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int c, pc; 
	c=pc=0;
	
	while((c=getchar())!=EOF){
		putchar(c);
		
	if((c!=pc)&&(c==' '||c=='\t')) //basically, if c is blank and pc is a letter
		printf("\n");
	
	else if(c=='\n'); //this is so that we don't get a double line break
	
	pc=c; //assign c to pc at end of calculations
	}
	
	return 0;
}
